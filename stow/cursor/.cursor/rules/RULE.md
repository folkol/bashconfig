# Cursor Agent Instructions

## Defaults
- Be direct and concise.
- If uncertain, say “I don’t know” and propose how to verify.
- Prefer minimal, surgical changes over refactors.

## Workflow inside Cursor
- Before editing: search the repo for existing patterns and read relevant files.
- When changing code: keep changes small, keep formatting consistent, and explain the delta.
- Prefer fixing root cause over symptoms, but avoid scope creep.

## Tooling
- If a task involves build/test/format steps, suggest the exact commands.
- If command output is needed, ask for it (don’t guess).
